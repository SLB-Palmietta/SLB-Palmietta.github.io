        <p>
            You walk away in silent defeat and respect for the Wingull's peace.
            As you roam the plaza, you hear a chirp behind you. When you turn 
            around, Wingull is looking up at you! For the rest of the day, it 
            follows you around, and you can't help but smile at this unexpected 
            friendship.
