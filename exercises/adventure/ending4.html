            Thankfully, the Pokéball tapped the Wingull just right! After a few 
            seconds, you succesfully catch the Wingull and wade into the water 
            to retrieve your Pokéball. Afterwards, you release Wingull and feed 
            it some snacks to gain its favor (it works). Congrats on gaining a 
            new Pokémon friend!!!
