        <h1>HOMEMADE POTATO CHIPS</h1>

        <p>
            These homemade potato chips bring the classic crunch of Lay's and 
            Ruffles right to your kitchen, but even better. With just the right 
            technique, you’ll achieve that perfect light yellow color and crispy 
            texture. If they came straight out of a chip bag, you wouldn’t even 
            be able to tell the difference!

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                2 to 3 large potatoes (Russet or Yukon Gold)
            </li>
            
            <li>
                4 to 6 cups neutral oil (vegetable, canola, or avocado)
            </li>
            
            <li>
                salt, to taste
            </li>
            
            <li>
                black pepper (optional)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Slice the Potatoes:</b>

                Wash and peel the potatoes. Use a mandolin slicer to cut the 
                potatoes into thin slices, 
                <br>
                about 1/16 to 1/8-inch thick. For 
                regular chips, use the straight blade; for ruffle-style chips, 
                use the ridge-cut blade.
            </li>
            
            <br>

            <li>
                <b>Soak the Slices:</b>

                Place the potato slices in a bowl of ice water and soak for 
                20-30 minutes. This helps to remove 
                <br>
                excess starch, making the chips crispier.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                <b>Rinse and Dry:</b>

                Drain the potatoes and rinse under cold water until the water 
                runs clear. Pat each slice dry thoroughly 
                <br>
                with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Ensuring the slices 
                are dry is crucial for crispy chips and prevents oil splatters.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                <b>Heat the Oil:</b>

                In a deep pot or pan, heat the oil to 320°F. 
                Maintaining this temperature is key to achieving that 
                <br>
                light yellow color without over-browning.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                <b>Fry in Small Batches:</b>

                Carefully add a small batch of potato slices to the oil, 
                ensuring not to overcrowd the pot. 
                <br>
                This helps keep the oil temperature steady. After each batch, 
                check the temperature and let it return to 325-330°F if needed.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                <b>Create the Folds:</b>

                As the chips begin to fry, gently stir and push them along the 
                edges of the pot with a slotted spoon to 
                <br>
                help form those signature folds and curls before they crisp up.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                <b>Cook to Perfection:</b>

                Fry the chips for 3-5 minutes or until they are crisp and a 
                light yellow color. Remove them from the oil 
                <br>
                with a slotted spoon and place them on a wire rack set over a 
                baking sheet to drain any excess oil.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                <b>Season and Serve:</b>
                
                While the chips are still hot, sprinkle them with salt and a 
                pinch of black pepper, if desired. 
                <br>
                Enjoy them fresh, or store in an airtight container once cooled.
            </li>
        </ol>
