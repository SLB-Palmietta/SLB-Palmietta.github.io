                <p>
                    Lara Croft is an English archaeologist, treasure hunter and 
                    tomb raider. Born to an aristocratic family, Lara is 
                    generally disinterested in upper class society, finding it 
                    stifling and boring. She takes far more interest in delving 
                    into the secrets of the past and finding what is believed to 
                    not even exist. Lara's expeditions have led her to search 
                    for some of the most powerful and dangerous artifacts in the 
                    world as well as uncovering some of the most mysterious 
                    places in Earth's history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lara's exploits are legendary, even garnering a reputation, 
                    though occasionally that reputation is less than flattering. 
                    Lara is often in race against time with those who seek the 
                    same relics she does for nefarious intentions. Lara has 
                    thwarted many groups and individuals who are incredibly well 
                    equipped or powerful, including crazed religious cults, mad 
                    scientists and even gods. Lara will often lock up some of 
                    the more powerful relics in her manor, in order to keep 
                    them out of anyone's hands but her own and if the situation 
                    requires it, she may even destroy the artifact if need be.
                </p>

                <h2 class="underline">Incarnations of Lara Croft</h2>

                <p>
                    Throughout the years, Lara has existed in multiple universes 
                    ever since her debut. At present, there are eight official 
                    incarnations of Lara Croft.

                <h3>Similarities</h3>

                <p>
                    Though each incarnation of Lara is similar, each one does 
                    have unique attributes, there are several recurring story 
                    features and themes within the timelines.
                </p>

                <h4>Design</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Lara's appearance remains that of a tall woman with a 
                        slender build and a slightly muscular physique.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Lara's default attire usually consists of a tank top, 
                        shorts, socks, and combat boots. Usually with an aqua 
                        and brown color scheme. Other color schemes include 
                        black and grey as well.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Lara almost always wears her hair in a braid or 
                        ponytail. Though she always styles the front 
                        differently. In her younger years, she wears pigtails.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Lara's main choice of weaponry has usually been two 
                        pistols and a shotgun.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                </ul>

                <h2 class="underline">Original Concept</h2>

                <p>
                    When Tomb Raider was initially being developed, the game was 
                    set to star a character reminiscent of a moustachioed 
                    Indiana Jones, right down to attire. During development, 
                    the character was scrapped and a new character was created.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The original redesign leads to a South American Mercenary 
                    named Laura Cruz, inspired by the Swedish singer, 
                    Neneh Cherry, and the comic book heroine, Tank Girl. 
                    Core Design later decided to rename her to Lara and make her 
                    a hometown hero, and changed Lara's origin to England. Going 
                    through the phone book to find a name that sounded similar 
                    to the name they had, they found the name "Lara Croft" and 
                    renamed their character, as well as giving her an upper 
                    class upbringing. 
                </p>

                <h2 class="underline">Reception & Cultural Impact</h2>

                <p>
                    Lara Croft has been massively popular since her debut in 
                    1996. She is seen by many to be the number one heroine in 
                    gaming history, surpassing the likes of Samus Aran from the
                    Metroid series. Lara Croft and the Tomb Raider series 
                    currently have 6 official Guinness World Records, 
                    including "Best Selling Video Game Heroine." Lara's 
                    popularity lead to her being adapted to other forms 
                    of media as well as being used in advertising for products 
                    such as Lucozade, a brand of energy drink, Seat cars, the 
                    Visa card and even a line of chocolate bars.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lara garnered status as a sex symbol of gaming, leading to 
                    her being portrayed by various models for photo-shoots. 
                    However, this contributed to Toby Gard leaving Core Design 
                    in 1997, as it was against his intended creation of the 
                    character. Also, feminist groups took issue about Lara's 
                    sex appeal being used for marketing purposes, as well as 
                    parental groups who objected to sexual content in video 
                    ames. In 2009, a ring road in Derby was named 
                    "Lara Croft Way" after the local council opened a vote to 
                    the public to decide the road's name. Lara Croft Way won 
                    the public vote with a landslide 89% of overall votes 
                    numbering over 27,000. Lara had a star on the Walk of 
                    Game in San Francisco before the area was renovated.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lara's classic attire of a tank top, shorts, and combat 
                    boots has become a recurring garb of female explorers 
                    within the genre, similar to how more classic movie heroes 
                    would wear a fedora and leather jacket, which is notably 
                    worn by the characters, David Jones in China, Fred C. Dobbs 
                    in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Harry Steele in The 
                    Secret of the Incas or Indiana Jones from the franchise of 
                    the same name.
