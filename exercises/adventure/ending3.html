        <p>
            Your Pokéball whizzes through the air and nails the Wingull right in 
            the head with a loud "thunk". The Wingull screeches in anger, and 
            it starts flying back toward you and ready to attack. Better start 
            running, Wingull doesn't look too happy!!
