        <h2 style="margin: 20px;">SYNOPSIS</h2>

        <p style="margin: 20px; width: 1281px;">
            WALL-E, short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class, is the 
            last robot left on Earth. He spends his days tidying up the planet, 
            one piece of garbage at a time. But during 700 years, WALL-E has 
            developed a personality, and he's more than a little lonely. Then 
            he spots EVE, a sleek and shapely probe sent back to Earth on a 
            scanning mission. Smitten WALL-E embarks on an adventure when he 
            follows EVE across the galaxy.

        <p style="width: 1281px; margin: 20px;">
            This movie still makes me cry. The emotions put into this movie is 
            insane, and even now it will forever remain as my all-time favorite 
            movie. WALL-E is such a sweet robot, and he goes across the galaxy 
            just to be with a robot he fell in love with. Because of that, he 
            ends up saving all of mankind, and makes so many new friends, humans 
            and robots alike. I aspire to be like WALL-E, and anyone who watches 
            this movie should feel the same.

        <p style="width: 1281px; margin: 20px;">
            Surfing means everything to teenage penguin Cody Maverick 
            (Shia LaBeouf). Followed by a documentary film crew, he leaves his 
            home in Antarctica for Pen Gu Island, site of the the Big Z Memorial 
            Surf Off. Cody wants to be respected and admired, and he believes 
            that winning the competition will bring him what he craves.

        <p style="width: 1281px; margin: 20px;">
            Penguins surfing. And a chicken. If that's not the most amazing 
            movie idea you've ever heard, I don't know what else to say. 
            Growing up, I watched this movie every day (along with many others),
            and I never got tired of it. It's literally a hilarious documentary 
            about a teenage penguin who enters a surfing competition, and his 
            best friend is a surfing chicken. Cody finds love, discovers his 
            hero is alive, and has the time of his life. Truly a 10/10 movie.

        <h2 style="margin: 20px;">SYNOPSIS</h2>

        <p style="width: 1281px; margin: 20px;">
            Racecar Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his tow-truck buddy, 
            Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), have had their share of adventures 
            together but nothing like what they experience when they head 
            overseas for the first-ever World Grand Prix. While Lightning 
            has his eye on the road to the championship, Mater takes a detour 
            to international espionage when he meets British master spy Finn 
            McMissile (Michael Caine) and stunning spy-in-training Holley 
            Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer).

        <p style="width: 1281px; margin: 20px;">
            This movie was downright one of the coolest that came out when I was 
            little, and it's still one of my favorite movies to this day. Now 
            obviously, now that I'm older, I realize how insane it was that this 
            movie was made for kids. There's definitely a lot of violence, and 
            even a death scene for a spy car. But nevertheless, I still love it,
            and I'm pretty sure this movie is the reason I like action movies so 
            much.
